# Welcome to My Blog

tags: "example", "getting-started"

This is your first blog post. You can edit or delete this file and add your own posts to the `posts/` directory.

## How posts work

Each post is a Markdown file in the `posts/` directory. The filename format is:

```
YYYYMMDD_slug-goes-here.md
```

For example, this file is `20260101_welcome.md` and it will appear at `/blog/welcome`.

## Writing a post

Every post starts with a title (an `# H1` heading), an optional `tags:` line, and then the body content:

```markdown
# My Post Title

tags: "tag1", "tag2"

Your content goes here. You can use all standard **Markdown** features.
```

## Supported Markdown features

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- [Links](https://github.com)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting (see below)
- Blockquotes
- Tables
- Horizontal rules

### Code example

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

### Blockquote example

> The best way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.

Happy blogging!
